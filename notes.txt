AT (Always Taken): Predicts that every branch will always be taken.
NT (Never Taken): Predicts that every branch will never be taken.
BTFNT (Backward Taken, Forward Not Taken): Predicts backward branches (e.g., loops) as taken and forward branches as not taken.
BPB (Branch Prediction Buffer): Uses a buffer to store branch history and predict outcomes based on past behavior.
HCNP (Hierarchical Contextual Neural Predictor): An advanced predictor using neural networks and hierarchical context to model complex branch behavior.
